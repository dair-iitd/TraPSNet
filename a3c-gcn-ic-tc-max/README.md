- To start the training use this command

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh 5
```
- replace 5 with the instance number you want to run
- allowed instances are (1-30)
- largest instance is 10
- smallest instance is 1
- if you want to run multiple instances at once use ',' separated numbers (eg. 5,12,17,10)
- more instances you run at once, more time it will take to start the code
- for playing with other parameters edit run.sh
